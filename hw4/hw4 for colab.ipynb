The resulting output will be of size (10, 16, 16, 8) due to the stride, and thus `out_grad` will have shape (10, 16, 16, 8). Yet, the gradient of the input needs to, of course, have shape (10, 32, 32, 8) -- so we must need to increase the size of `out_grad` in some way. Consider also that you could implement strided convolution as `Conv(x)[:, ::2, ::2, :]`, i.e., only keeping every other pixel in the spatial dimension.\n",

You must also implement the corresponding op `UnDilate`, whose forward pass will be used to implement the gradient of `Dilate`. (This is so we do not have to implement `GetItem` and `SetItem` ops, which can be highly inefficient to backprop through without additional optimizations.)\n",

    "**Note**: The dilation amount is additive, not multiplicative. In the example above, a dilation of `1` implies adding one row/column of zeros between each element along each dilated axis (and one removed row/column for each undilated axis). A dilation of `0` means no change."

Now, you have already implemented the backward pass of matrix multiplication in a previous assignment, and we can use this knowledge to get some insight into the backward pass of convolution. In particular, referencing your matmul backward implementation, you may notice (heuristically speaking here):\n",
