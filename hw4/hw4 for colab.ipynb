The resulting output will be of size (10, 16, 16, 8) due to the stride, and thus `out_grad` will have shape (10, 16, 16, 8). Yet, the gradient of the input needs to, of course, have shape (10, 32, 32, 8) -- so we must need to increase the size of `out_grad` in some way. Consider also that you could implement strided convolution as `Conv(x)[:, ::2, ::2, :]`, i.e., only keeping every other pixel in the spatial dimension.\n",

You must also implement the corresponding op `UnDilate`, whose forward pass will be used to implement the gradient of `Dilate`. (This is so we do not have to implement `GetItem` and `SetItem` ops, which can be highly inefficient to backprop through without additional optimizations.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The dilation amount is additive, not multiplicative. In the example above, a dilation of `1` implies adding one row/column of zeros between each element along each dilated axis (and one removed row/column for each undilated axis). A dilation of `0` means no change."

We also have `out_grad`, which is the same shape as `X @ W`. Now, you have already implemented the backward pass of matrix multiplication in a previous assignment, and we can use this knowledge to get some insight into the backward pass of convolution.
